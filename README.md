The `overall.py` file is the code used to create the overall timeline plot. The `subplots.py` file is the code used to create the subplots.

All data for this project was from the CSPAN Presidential Historian's Survey (https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/). Feel free to use the code for your own projects!
