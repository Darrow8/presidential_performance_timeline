The `overall.py` file is the code used to create the overall timeline plot. The `subplots.py` file is the code used to create the subplots.

All data for this project was from the [CSPAN Presidential Historian's Survey](https://www.c-span.org/presidential-historian-survey/). Feel free to use the code for your own projects!
